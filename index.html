    Robert Frost: Nothing Gold Can Stay
    </h1> 
    
<p>Nature’s first green is gold,<br>
Her hardest hue to hold.<br>
Her early leaf’s a flower;<br>
But only so an hour.<br>
Then leaf subsides to leaf <br>
So Eden sank to grief, <br>
So dawn goes down to day.<br>
  Nothing gold can stay.</p>

<h2 style="color: white"> Oscar Wilde: Symphony in Yellow
   </h2>

<p>An omnibus across the bridge<br>
Crawls like a yellow butterfly,<br>
And, here and there, a passer-by<br>
Shows like a little restless midge.</p>


<p>Big barges full of yellow hay<br>
Are moored against the shadowy wharf,<br>
And, like a yellow silken scarf,<br>
The thick fog hangs along the quay.</p>
    
<p>The yellow leaves begin to fade<br>
And flutter from the Temple elms,<br>
And at my feet the pale green Thames<br>
Lies like a rod of rippled jade.</p>
